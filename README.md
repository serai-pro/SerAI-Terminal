# SerAI-Terminal
This is how you can use the SerAI Terminal

So we first got these commands:

help - showing you the current commands avalabile
color blue/rainbow/red/black/yellow - here we got to change the terminal commands
echo - yeah this is just echo, I think we all know how this works
server - Shows in what locations are the servers located
send_message <Message> - like this you can send a request to the maing TDS API.
my_ip - Shows the Terminal IP
user_create <Username> - Like this you create a user.
api_create <Username> - With this you can access the API, As of 17.01.2024 this is optional you can access it by https://panel.serai.pro/TDS?message= too but just as of right now we are recommanding to do this because on 20.01.2024 we will remove it and make it FREE for PRO users.
